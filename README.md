# food-website

This is my first front-end website, where it features a food website that would allow people to input their location and the website would output all the resturants near them.

Although I only made the front page without javascript.

The website however is reactive and the layout changes at various dimensions of the webpage, there is also an option to input your location, however it doesn't do anything once 
the user presses enter.
